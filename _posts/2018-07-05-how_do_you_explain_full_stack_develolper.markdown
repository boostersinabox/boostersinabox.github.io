Over the Memorial Day weekend, I was asked by several family members what I was studying.  When I stated, "Full Stack Development", their faces became contorted followed by a "hu?”  I have been thinking about these interactions and decided dissect and explain the knowledge that must be acquired in or to become a full stack developer.

With just over 90% of Americans going online for a variety of reasons, every one of them interacts with a website and/or an app (application).  Facebook, online banking, Candy Crush app on your phone and even just a simple google search all have been developed through a series of knowledge and tools.  A full stack developer may or may not be the individual that came up with the idea of a website or app, but they have the experience to see the creation of the item from start to finish.

Let’s start with the terms front-end or back-end developers because the combination of these two give you a “Full Stack Developer”.  The word “stack” refers which of the tools you use on the front end and the back end to develop and deploy your site/app.  This is a very basic list of the areas broken down into front-end and back-end with a few tools listed for each area.  The goal of a full stack developer is to have proficient knowledge of the tools in the different areas.

## Front-End
This is the part the user sees and interacts with when going to a website or app.

Developer must understand the following:

*   Understand the customer and business’ needs

*   Creation of the interface and user experience.  These are just a few tools:
     *   HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the backbone of the Web. Every website is built with HTML. HTML takes care of the structure and content.

     *   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what controls the way the HTML looks on the website page.  It sets the page layout, colors, fonts, background images, etc.
     *   JavaScript adds the interactivity the user experiences.  Examples are more complex animations, scripts that run and change the screen based on user input, etc.  Several more advanced scripts used to be handled on the backend.  


## Back-End
This is the part the user does not see.  It is the logical back-end and core computational logic of a website. The components and features that are created in the backend are indirectly accessed by a user through the front-end.

Developer must understand the following: 

*  A Programming language(s).  Which is defined as a language that is used to specifies a set of instructions for the computer to execute.  Most developers may be proficient in one or two.
    *  Ruby
    *  Python
    *  Java
    *  C++
    *  Rust
    *  Elixir
*  Database development to store data collected and used.
    *  SQL
    *  DBAS
    *  FoxPro
    *  MongoDB
    *  ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
*  Scripting languages & frameworks to achieve a highly interactive website.
    *  PHP – (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side interpreted scripting language. It was designed for creating dynamic web pages and web pages that effectively work with databases.

    *  JavaScript Frameworks -  A framework is a collection of JavaScript tools that define the entire application design.  It also guides through predefined templates.
        *  AngularJs
        *  jQuery
        *  Node.js
        *  Bootstrap
        *  React
        *  AJAX
        *  JSON
*  Where the website reside?  
    *  Servers Types: 
        *  Apache (most popular)
        *  IIS – Microsoft Internet Information Server
        *  Nginx
        *  GWS - Google
        *  Domino – IBM’s web server
        *  AWS – Amazon Web Services through server farms throughout the world 
    *  Operating Systems:
        *  Linux 
        *  Unix
        *  Windows
        *  Mac OS X 
    *  Hosting Environments:
        *  Self Service Web Hosting
        *  Dedicated Web Server
        *  VPS (Virtual Private Server)
        *  Standard Web Hosting
        *  Cloud Based Web Hosting
*  Interaction with other sites and/or data
    *  API (Application Program Interface), using REST verbs
    *  Postman – share, test, document and monitor APIs
*  Quality assurance
    *  Git – A distributed version control system
    *  GitHub – A remote repository hosting service
    *  REPL - interactive computer programming environment that takes user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user.  You can test your code.
    *  Selenium – test browser compatibility
*  	Security
     *  	NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)
     *  	VPN (Virtual Private Network)
     *  	Firewalls
     *  	Anti-Virus Software
     *  	Encryption
     *  	Authorization / Authentication




## Whew! 
That is a lot of information!  A full stack developer spends many, many hours initially to learn all the different languages and tools.  Then it takes years of experience working in different languages and tools to become proficient.  Because of the learning demands, full stack development may not be a career for someone that is not committed to continually learning.  I love learing new things and consider myself a technology geek.  :-)  LinkedIn currently has over 7,000 jobs in the US and over 16,000 worldwide for full stack developers. I like the number of opportunities that I will have goining forward.
