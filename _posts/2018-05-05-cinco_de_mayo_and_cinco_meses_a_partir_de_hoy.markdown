We all know that Cinco de Mayo is the 5th of May, but today has me thinking about where I will be five months from today (cinco meses a partir de hoy).  Yes, I did google that translation.

I am a 30-year veteran of the financial services industry.  I turn 50 this year and I kept thinking to myself, "is this what I want to do for the next 15 years?"  The thought of it made my stomach turn.  

I have always been a computer / software nerd on the side.  Everything I know has been self-taught and I have always considered myself a "hack", not an expert in any way, shape or form.  But I loved it!

I made the decision to retire from financial services, because who wants stomach problems all the time.  :-)  What next?  I can't go back to school at 50.  I certainly can't go into coding which is a male dominated field.  Would I even be able to make it through the rigorous application process to be accepted?  

While driving myself crazy trying to decide, I came across a quote by the co-founder of one of my favorite sites, Poshmark.  Tracy Sun said:  “Love what you do and do what you love. Doing something new and different requires a level of drive and passion that is really hard to fake. When your heart is behind what you are doing, so much is possible.”

My passion and drive was there so I jumped in with both feet.  I feel blessed to have found Flatiron and the Web Developer / Full Stack Bootcamp.  I found Flatiron while searching for "women in coding".  I came across a blog post on the Lyft site (https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-x-flatiron-school) where Lyft was sponsoring scholarships for women to go to school for coding.  I was on fire by now.  I prepped myself, applied, was accepted, was offered a scholarship and now it is my 5th day in the program, on Cinco de Mayo!!!   My goal is to graduate five months from today, cinco meses a partir de hoy.   So, here's to me going from hack to full stack with a little Spanish on the side.
